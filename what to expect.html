<h1>How do we get to mars?</h1>
<p>				
TO get to Mars, will have to use a lot of thrust to leave earths atmosphere. Thats where
our spectacular Stark ship comes in. The stark ship will allows us escape earths gravity and
allow us to travel in space. Our stark ship has reusable fuel tanks so the cost of the stark
ship and to make the trip to Mars affordable.</p>

<h1>What is life like on mars?</h1>
<p> 
Currently, Mars is still a hostile world that does not have a breathable atmosphere. It also
is constantly being bombarded with radiation from the sun, making mars uninhabitable on the
surface. Human civilization will be held in underground bunkers that have natural protection from 
radiation making mars inhabitable. </p>

<h1>Why go to mars?</h1>
<p>
Going to mars is less of a question of why, but when. To advance our species to a space fairing
race, we need to take steps to do so. Populating mars is the first step to unlocking the rest 
of our solar system. Going to mars is key to the future of the human race. Now all that remains
is, are you the one to take us there?</p>
